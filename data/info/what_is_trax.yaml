  What is T-RAX?
  "
  description: "
  T-RAX is a student association managing the Chalmers makerspace Fuse by evenings and weekends.
  The makerspace allows students and teachers to learn and experiment with practical manufacturing methods 
  as well as to work on private projects that lie outside the regular education.
  The makerspace offers a wide range of modern labs and workshops from metalworking to VR and textile.
  By providing several different labs, the possibility for creating interdisciplinary projects is endless. "
