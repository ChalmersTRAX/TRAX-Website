    question: "I am not a student or employee at Chalmers but would like to become a member, can I?"
    answer: Anyone can join T-RAX with or without CID/connection to Chalmers. But members without a CID are a bit limited. 
            Members without a CID can not access Canvas or our booking system Skedda or get card access. 
            This means they can not book machines or read the rules the Fuse staff/Chalmers has for everyone 
            using the Fuse facilities or enter the workshops themselves. 
            <br><br>
            Without an active connection to Chalmers they are not covered by Chalmers insurance the same way. 
            Therefore a member without a CID may only use the workshops when let in/accompanied by the board. 
            They can still attend our courses and workshops/events but can not use the machines independently like members with a CID.

    question: "I have taken some workshop courses with the Fuse staff, can I credit these to T-RAX?"
    answer:   "This may be possible, but we need to do some checks first. 
              Please email info@t-rax.se with when you took the courses (course code as well) and if you remember the name of the person who held the course. 
              We will then get back to you if the course you took contained everything necessary to be able to use the workshops independently during T-RAX time.
              <br><br>
              If the course I want credited is metal or/and wood:<br>
              You will then also need to come by during our opening hours and attend a workshop T-RAX rules walkthrough (15 minutes) and sign a contract. "
