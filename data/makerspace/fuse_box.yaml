      Free member storage exists in the FUSE-box, this is located behind the big TV-screen in the corner. 
      Two of these shelves are reserved for T-RAX members (Shelf 5 and 6) 
      <br><br>
      These shelves house boxes in three sizes, every box has a unique identifier and are suitable for smaller items/projects that fit in the boxes. 
      It does not cost anything and you can use one box without question, you can use more if needed but contact the T-RAX board with motivation. 
      If you need more storage, try to use a bigger box instead of several smaller ones, try to use "reasonable" sizes for your needs.

      <br><br> <b>It is not allowed to store the following in the boxes: </b> <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Any consumables (food, snacks, drinks etc.)</li>
          <li>Any chemicals (such as fuels, solvents, glues, non water based paints/lacquers etc.) </li>
          <li>Lithium batteries of any sort (we have a separate locker for that)</li>
          <li>Active electronics (make sure that all power sources are unplugged and can not be short circuited)</li>
          <li>Valuables (technically allowed but not recommended)</li>
        </ul>
      <b>Rules</b> 
        <ul>
          <li>You are allowed to claim one box with no questions ( If more is needed contact the T-RAX board with motivation)</li>
          <li>Use a bigger box if more storage is necessary before asking for more boxes</li>
          <li>Donâ€™t use a bigger box if you don't have a need for it. It is better to change boxes later instead</li>
          <li>All items stored in boxes must fit inside the boxes (no stuff sticking out)</li>
          <li>The boxes have to fit and be placed on the T-RAX member storage shelves (5 and 6)</li>
          <li>Any stuff or boxes with no up to date sticker(from the roll) on will be thrown away</li>
        </ul>
      You can claim a box at any time, but during study week 7 a parking ticket will be placed inside all boxes. 
      We send out a message in our members facebook group when the parking tickets are placed. 
      If the parking ticket is still left and your sticker is not updated with a new date of claim on wednesday of study week 1 your box will be cleared and the contents will be thrown away.
      <br><br><b>When you want to start using an empty box: </b>
        <ol>
          <li>Fill out the <a href= "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-iNp5IP2PtiEOhFjUrGl-lJXldUoLm75kKkORSWmO0P8kGQ/viewform" target="_blank">form</a> to register your box. (You can modify the information)</li>
          <li>Fill out the sticker and put it on the box (Stickers can be found on a roll at shelf 1)</li>
          <li>Put your stuff in the box (you can also put on a lid on the box if you want)</li>
        </ol>
      If you wish to unclaim your box before the end of the study period simply enter the form again and change the information,
      and mark your sticker on the box with an X over your information.
